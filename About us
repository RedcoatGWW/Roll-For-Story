  <h1> We are Roll For Story</h1>
  <h2> Created by the players, for the players</h2>
  <p> Roll for story is a dungeons and Dragons community founded in 2014. Starting with Chris (Senrith) he brought together a group of friends and strangers to play though his homebrew campaign 'Baba Yaga's Dancing hut'. The campaign was a success and was eventually streamed to twitch. From there the community has branched out gathering more players to join the adventures. Roll for story is here to continue to bring players to the table with ease and fun. Where will your next journey take you? </p>
